I'm Vignesh, an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. 
I am passionate about building products and solutions that have the potential to positively impact society. 
I am currently learning about disruptive software and honing my technical skills. 
I’m looking for any interesting and challenging ideas to work on!
